# youtube links can be modified with certain tricks in the URL

Modifications require a "$" sign at the beginning of a link to tell it to get specific options\
if you want to add more than 1 modification you have to put the "&" sign betwem each\

1. **Autoplay**\
autoplay can be archieved trought writting it this way\
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ$autoplay=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ$autoplay=1)\

2. **Loop**
Loop is similar just add loop=1\
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ$loop=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ$loop=1)\
_note: it won't work as a link directly to the video, might work for other video formats sent trought plaform such as discord_\

3. **Muted video**\
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ$mute=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ$mute=1)\
The video will be muted but usually mute comes with autoplay to not make the user get an unnexpected scarejump at the start of a video

4. **During the video, no suggestions inside the video**\
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ$rel=0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ$rel=0)\
this frame will not show more videos after it played.\

5. **start at specific time**\
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ?t=13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ?t=13)\
the amount of second be stored there as seconds "?t=13".

### examples of combinations

Autoplay + Looped + Muted + no suggestion + starting at 15 sec\
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ$autoplay=1&loop=1&mute=1&rel=0&?t=13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ$autoplay=1&loop=1&mute=1&rel=0&?t=13)

you can use those concepts well on Markdown files or by sending such a link to a friend of yours

## Other websites trick
These tricks are from youtube itself\
but there are other tricks out there like other website that hold all the videos that can do certain things\
by adding certain keywords to a youtube link, the video will apear on another site



when we have a video we want to loop we can add to the link 
1.
```
www.youtuberepeater.com
```

which is another site that still contains all of the videos with thier corresonding links\
[https://www.youtuberepeater.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ](https://www.youtuberepeater.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ)

```
www.youxube.com
```
which is another one for looping videos
[https://www.youxube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ](https://www.youxube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ)

2.
```
www.nsfwyoutube.com
```
which can bypass the age restriction on videos.
[https://www.nsfwyoutube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ](https://www.nsfwyoutube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ)
Don't worry, theres nothing specificly NFSW its litterally just a bypass of the age restriction we all hate in europe
**Note: google deactivated that function**

3.
```
www.gifyoutube.com
```
Which is here to make gifs easely out of videos
[https://www.gifyoutube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ](https://www.gifyoutube.com/watch?v=wu4l0qSohLQ)
You will be put on "gif.com" and it will show also that its an unsafe site.
But theres no risk about it :b


4.
```
https://yewtu.be
```
Which not only holds you Annonymous but also allows you to open any video that got age restricted
My favorite of all there
